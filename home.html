        <h1>Hi, I'm Nils!<br>
            Stockholm-based Product Designer with 10+ years of experience in the tech industry. Currently working at Atlar.</h1>
        <p class="primary">
            Throughout my career, I have mostly been part of cross-functional teams consisting of product managers, developers, data scientists, and researchers. Together, we have developed and released various features across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Web, and TV.</p>
        <p class="primary">
            While I consider research and user testing as natural part of my workflow to craft great products, my true passion lies in tinkering with complex prototypes and focusing on the nitty-gritty aspects of design.
        </p>
