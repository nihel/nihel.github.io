    <h1>Billboard Promos</h1>
    <p class="secondary">
        We display a billboard on our start page across all platforms, highlighting our content. Our aim is to make it even better by adding promos, a 15 sec trailer. This helps users find something to watch and makes our product feel more exciting and inspiring.

        The TV app is the sole platform where we opt to enable sound by default, primarily because of its compatibility with the TV remote.

        Because the player operates as a consistently positioned layer beneath the interface, we achieve smooth transitions between the start and product pages even while the promo is playing.

        The promos on the billboard were displayed for only a week. To maximize the efforts invested, we linked the promos to the product ID. This allowed us to play the promos on the product pages, ensuring continued visibility and impact.
