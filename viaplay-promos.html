    <h1>Billboard Promos</h1>
    <p class="secondary">
        We display a billboard on our start page across all platforms, highlighting our content. Our aim is to make it even better by adding promos. This helps users find something to watch and makes our product feel more exciting and inspiring.
        We use the same file for all platforms, but we tailor the focus of the promo to suit phones. This results in two formats: 16:9 and 3:4.

        The streaming team faced a challenge in finding the right codec for the file. We required high quality while keeping the file size small. Enabling the auto-play function came with significant costs.
        Guidelines were established for the content team regarding how to edit promos. These guidelines involve excluding violence and spoilers while including a fade-in and fade-out effect.

        The TV app is the sole platform where we opt to enable sound by default, primarily because of its compatibility with the TV remote. Switching between mute and sound through the interface would be quite cumbersome otherwise.
        <br>
Because the player operates as a distinct layer consistently positioned beneath the interface, we achieve smooth transitions between the start and product pages even while the promo is playing.
