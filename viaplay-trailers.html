        Stockholm-based Product Designer with 10+ years of experience in the tech industry. Currently working at Atlar.
Throughout my career, I have mostly been part of cross-functional teams consisting of product managers, developers, data scientists, and researchers. Together, we have developed and released various features across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Web, and TV.

While I consider research and user testing as natural part of my workflow to craft great products, my true passion lies in tinkering with complex prototypes and focusing on the nitty-gritty aspects of design.
